# Website-host-on-S3

Hello everyone!!

In this Project, I have used  the AWS service and worked on, which is Amazone S3 bucket and Route53. In AmazoneS3 bucket, I have put my website files there and Route53 I have used for creating DNS zones. I have purchased a free domain from Freenom and created the all the DNS records on Route53.
